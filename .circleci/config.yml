            # Locally, calling `./gradlew bintrayUpload` is enough to generate
            # all the required artifacts. On CI, unless run each task
            # individually, the Bintray task will fail to find the .aar and
            # pom.xml artifacts in the build/ folder.

            # On local, the POM is generated automatically as part of
            # assembleRelease, but that doesn't seem to be the case on CI. Here
            # we need to explicitly generated it, otherwise bintrayUpload won't
            # find it and won't upload it.
            #
            # Worth noting that the Bintray plugin mentions the necessity for
            # a workaround to generate the POM. See:
