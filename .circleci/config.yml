            # Locally, calling `./gradlew bintrayUpload` is enough to generate
            # all the required artifacts. On CI, unless run each task
            # individually, the Bintray task will fail to find the AAR and
            # POM artifacts in the build/ folder.
            #
            # This builds the AAR.
            #./gradlew --stacktrace assembleRelease

            # This builds the POM.
            #
            # On local, the POM is generated automatically as part of
            # assembleRelease, but that doesn't seem to be the case on CI. Here
            # we need to explicitly generated it, otherwise bintrayUpload won't
            # find it and won't upload it.
            #
            # Worth noting that the Bintray plugin mentions the necessity for
            # some workarounds to generate the POM under certain circumstances,
            # although none of them apply to our current usage. See:
